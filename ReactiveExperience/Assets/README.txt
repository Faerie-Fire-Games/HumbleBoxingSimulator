How To Play (It's Easy!)
- To play "A Humble Boxing Simulator: Lovingly Handcrafted By A Very Tired Individual", all you need to do is *read* the information on screen.
- Then once you have deduced what you can about the initial state of the game, choose a technique from the four options in the bottom left with the left mouse button.
- More text will appear on screen, detailing the result of your decision and your opponents decision. Read this information too.
- Come to another conclusion on what you would like to do, perhaps influenced by this *new* information.
- At some point, notice that your agility steadily goes down as the fight drags on. Try repositioning to maintain the advantage!
- Try *not* to notice that spamming the attack button is the optimal strategy. This is a mistake in the developers balancing.
- Notice that when either fighter drops to 0 health, they do not immediately get knocked out. Instead they are able to hold on for a while longer.
- This lasts until they fail a willpower failure. Willpower is your secret second health bar. Isn't that neat?

What Was I Thinking?
	The goal of this project was to emulate the micro level story telling of fighting movies/anime/manga ect. Instead of telling a wide arching narrative, I attempt to create drama in split second moments. To some extent I feel like I actually failed in this endevor. Don't get me wrong, I like this sort of DnD/Pokemon fighting system, and with more cool randomness and a proper AI it could be genuinely nail biting I think, especially with the willpower saving mechanic. But as it stands, what story is there when the opponent just randomly chooses an attack. Oh well. I think the colours I chose for the UI were bad, however I actually kind of love how spartan the overall layout is. I think it's neat to make a boxing match so,,, academic? Anyway I won't waste any more of your time. That was my intention, to create a very zoomed in story generator. It went okay!



No 3rd Party Assets were used. As I said on the title screen it is lovingly *hand*crafted.. By a tired individual.
The product doesn't reflect the love you see.
But it's still kinda neat.
I mean mostly as just a monument to what brute forcing something.
Fun fact, I encountered less than ten errors while making this whole thing? It may be complex, but I *always* knew what I was doing at least.
Maybe that means I didn't challenge myself enough.
But I also procrastinated this until just before and even after the last minute soooo.
Yeah anyway.
